## how to use `flow-typed`?

```
yarn add --dev flow-typed

yarn run flow-typed -- install jest@^20

```
## how does it work?
pretty much the same as `typings` or `definitely-typed` in typescript.

https://flow.org/en/docs/libdefs/#toc-what-s-a-library-definition
>NOTE: Using the /flow-typed directory for libdefs is a convention that enables Flow to JustWorkâ„¢ out of the box and encourages consistency across projects that use Flow, but it is also possible to explicitly configure Flow to look elsewhere for libdefs using the [libs] section of your .flowconfig.
